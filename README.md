# Foodsur

Foodsur is a progressive web app that eliminates the difficulty in finding out if a food item meets your dietary requirements. Using Edamam's api, foodsur identifies if a given item is at odds with a user's dietary concerns. Users can scan the products UPC or use text search to locate items and see if their dietary preferences are met by a products. 

Users can also add favourite products to come back to later, and also view their caloric and macro nutrient profile. Users can also view popular items that match the users dietary preferences and see how many other users have added these items to their favourites.
